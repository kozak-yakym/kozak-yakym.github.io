                    <span class="description" style="display:block;">
                        A tool designed for visualizing data from a heating system equipped with a wood-burning boiler. Initially created to assist in understanding the operational dynamics of a boiler system through the visualization of sensor data collected via a custom-built RF sensor acquisition system.

                    <span class="description" style="display:block;">
                        The primary challenge was to devise a method that allowed for the effective monitoring and analysis of a wood-burning boiler heating system's performance using sensor data. This endeavor required surmounting technical hurdles, notably the necessity for an enhanced data visualization strategy. My aim was to develop a graphical representation that supported detailed examination through zooming capabilities and the ability to isolate a single curve for focused analysis. Additionally, I sought to implement a feature that would enable the comparison of two distinct curves, facilitating the identification of potential correlations.

                    <span class="description" style="display:block;">
                        The solution involved the development of a PC application in Python for data visualization. This application processes data collected from various sensors placed throughout the heating system and visualizes it to provide insights into the system's performance. External data, such as outdoor temperature from a weather server API, was also integrated to compensate for sensor limitations.
